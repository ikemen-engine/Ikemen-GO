- For usage in Mugen 1.0
- This bonus game is not compatible with chars that cannot be thrown (but won't hang)
- This bonus game is meant to be played on stages that already have a BGM



=====<Installation>=====

- Extract Catwalk.rar to your Mugen\chars folder
- Add "Catwalk," to your select.def, under [Characters]



=====<Introduction>=====

  This bonus game was inspired from a mini-game with the same name found in SNK vs Capcom:
Match of the Millenium, for the Neo Geo Pocket Color, where you could take control of Felicia
in a Dance Dance Revolution kind of game at the sound of classic fighting game themes.

  In the same spirit, and taking full advantage of Mugen's free for all aspect, this bonus game
allows you to play the same kind of game but, rather than being limited to Felicia, as any
character you want, provided it's available for Mugen.  Characters will even strike poses
according to the button(s) you just pressed and (limited to compatibility) shout random things
while at it.

  As for the music, since including it in the game would not only limit your choice but make
the file size too large, I decided that it should be played at the sound of the background
music in whatever stage you choose to play it in.

  Finally, the objective here is, you guessed it, pressing the correct button combination
displayed on the catwalk as they pass under the green line.  Difficulty will increase as rounds
go by or as you score high combos, increasing the ammount of points you get for each correct
button press along with it, which will then be displayed at the end of each round, along with
your highest combo and success ratio.

  I think that covers all the basics (...and I hate writing these things ;P) so all that's left
for me to say is, have fun and go for the high score!



=====<Compatibility>=====

  Any character that is vulnerable to being thrown can be used in this game.  That means any
except the giant boss type, some unconventional novelty chars or just plain broken stuff.

  Due to "engine limitations", though, only a selected few are compatible with the random shout
sound feature, listed below:

- Characters by myself (Phantom.of.the.Server)
- Characters by Andrés Borghi
- Characters by Baby Bonnie Hood
- Characters by GM
- Characters by Jesuszilla
- Characters by jin
- Characters by N-Mario
- Characters by Sepp
- Characters by The Necromancer/FlowaGirl
- Characters by Warusaki3
- Kung Fu Man by Elecbyte
- Homer Simpson by Warner and JudgeSpear

  It's possible some of these characters, except mine, will shout incorrect sounds at times due
to how people's methods and standards change with time, but because of the game's humorous
spirit it's not really a big deal.

  I also look forward to adding sound compatibility with more characters, the only requirement
is that the author organized voice samples by sound groups and not spread them all over the SND file,
so that I can easily call them to use.  Well, that and I'm not going to list characters one by
one, so it's only really worth it if said author used the same sound groups in several of his
works.  Writing this here both so that you can point me to potential compatible characters
(rather, authors, yourself included) if you want, and that I don't get plagued with "Why didn't
you make X character compatible?" questions.
